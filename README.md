==========================
Technical task:
> (a) Write a program in Python or another language of your choice that 
> prints the numbers from 1 to 100, one per line.  However for multiples 
> of 3 print “Kit” instead of the number and for the multiples of five 
> print “Kat”.  For numbers which are a multiple of both 3 and 5, print 
> “KitKat”.
>     
> (b) Modify your program above so that it does not use any of the division or
> modulus operators ("/", "//", or "%" in Python), either directly or
> indirectly.

My solution to task (a) is found in `problemA.py`, and my solution to task (b)
in `problemB.py`.

`tests.py` provides unit tests for the various functions contained in these
modules.

The solutions are written for Python 3, and the `tests.py` in particular makes use of features which are not backward compatible.
